VisualLocBaml
=============

 Visual Locbaml is a software to simplify the task of WPF application localization.

Serving as a translation database which keeps all your strings along with their translations 
for your WPF application, Visual Locbaml can do the following:

   * Extract new and modified strings defined in XAML files from your application binary
   * Allows you to translate strings into multiple languages
   * Stores original strings along with their translations in the database
   * Generates sattelite resource libraries for every target language

Also Visual Locbaml allows you to troubleshoot your localization more quickly, 
in case some strings is missing or translated incorrectly.

Visual LocBaml is implemented in the way, similar to the Microsoft's LocBaml tool 
sample with some additional features. Applications which were previousely 
localized with LocBaml tool from Microsoft or using any other similar tool 
can be easily localized using Visual LocBaml.
